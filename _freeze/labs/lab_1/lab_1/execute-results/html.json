The department is considering implementing an algorithmic system to identify communities that should receive priority for social service funding and outreach programs. Your supervisor has asked you to evaluate the quality and reliability of available census data to inform this decision.\n\nDrawing on our Week 2 discussion of algorithmic bias, you need to assess not just what the data shows, but how reliable it is and what communities might be affected by data quality issues.\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\n- Apply dplyr functions to real census data for policy analysis\n- Evaluate data quality using margins of error \n- Connect technical analysis to algorithmic decision-making\n- Identify potential equity implications of data reliability issues\n- Create professional documentation for policy stakeholders\n\n## Submission Instructions\n\n**Submit by posting your updated portfolio link on Canvas.** Your assignment should be accessible at `your-portfolio-url/labs/lab_1/`\n\nMake sure to update your `_quarto.yml` navigation to include this assignment under an \"Labs\" menu.\n\n# Part 1: Portfolio Integration\n\nCreate this assignment in your portfolio repository under an `labs/lab_1/` folder structure.

that there are some substantial margins of error. However, I was surprised to see that all 804 census tracts in this analysis were flagged for having at least one MOE of any race greater than 15%.\nIn further pattern analysis, Black & Hispanic tracts have significantly more flagged as having High Margins of Error (there is only 1! Latino tract with an Acceptable MOE!). This means Black and Latino residents of these 3 counties are significantly worse represented in the data.\n\n\n# Part 5: Policy Recommendations\n\n## 5.1 Analysis Integration and Professional Summary\n\n**Your Task:** Write an executive summary that integrates findings from all four analyses.\n\n**Executive Summary Requirements:**\n1. **Overall Pattern Identification**: What are the systematic patterns across all your analyses?\n2. **Equity Assessment**: Which communities face the greatest risk of algorithmic bias based on your findings?\n3. **Root Cause Analysis**: What underlying factors drive both data quality issues and bias risk?\n4. **Strategic Recommendations**: What should the Department implement to address these systematic issues?\n\n**Executive Summary:**\nA common pattern across the four analyses is that data quality issues are not random, but are concentrated around certain communities. Black and Latino communities and tracts with smaller populations have significantly higher margins of error. By initially flagging for a tract having potentially unreliable data when any of the three analyzed racial groups' (white, Black, Latino) margin of error was greater than 15%, this encompassed all 804 included tracts, suggesting a high-level of data unreliability. However, further steps looking into the data more granularly very quickly highlighted that the margin of error is extremely high for Latino (>99%) and Black (>98%) tracts. This means, amongst other concerns, that data quality issues specifically related to these racial groups may be overlooked or unaddressed. \nFollowing this, Black and Latino communities face the greatest risk of algorithmic bias. The data attributed to these groups in the ACS surveys are estimates with extremely high margins of error and rates of margins of error. The level of uncertainty and how widespread this quality issue spreads both signify that these data are unlikely to reflect the true population. And, with a less accurate picture of these communities, plans and community action are more likely to overlook and/or plan without adequate consideration for these groups.\nUnderlying factors that may drive data quality issues and/or bias risk include the data collection methods. As previously stated, the ACS is a survey of citizens conducted more frequently than the decennial census. Thus, the ACS data are based on a sample of the complete population. When estimating the demographics of, for example, smaller communities (the tract level is relatively small and hard to encapsulate) can have larger margins of error just based on the sample size and how the sample is translated to different geographies. Additionally, groups that have been historically marginalized are less likely to be well-covered in this data and therefore may be marginalized further.\nDespite its challenges, ACS data is a significant opportunity for understanding change over time and dates more frequent than the Census. It is, however, absolutely necessary for the Department to address these systematic issues, in order to utilize this data as a tool without perpetuating certain groups' marginalization. The department can make use of the flagging mechanisms used here to set a threshold for when a Margin Of Error is significant; when data are flagged for having high margins of error, this can be noted and taken into account in planning. Specifically, when high MOEs are flagged, either further data collection/research can be produced or the data can be not the primary driver of any planning decisions.\n\n\n## 6.3 Specific

immediate algorithmic implementation:** PA has primarily counties with high confidence based on these parameters. Allegheny and Philadelphia counties both fall into this category. These counties' data are solid at the county level, but as seen in this analysis, planners must be aware of the groups who are hidden and whose data is not flagged at the county level despite its low confidence at smaller geographies. \n\n2. **Counties requiring additional oversight:** Cameron, Carbon, Elk, Forest (ANALYSIS), Greene, Montour, Snyder, SUllivan, Union, and Warren counties have moderate reliability data. This means that the data may be okay, but planners relying on this data should be aware of this flag and be prepared to adapt or complete further data collection.\n\n3. **Counties needing alternative approaches:** PA has no counties with low confidence based on these parameters. However, since all 804 PA tracts analyzed across three counties were found to be unreliable, planners should be aware of the subgroups within counties that may be overlooked or misrepresented by seemingly high-confidence data.\n\n## Questions for Further Investigation\nTo what extent is it possible to most-completely overcome algorithmic bias?\nHow much does the confidence TRULY increase at a scale such as county as compared to tracts without continuing to miss the same overlooked, marginalized groups?\n\n# Technical Notes\n\n**Data Sources:** \n- U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 2018-2022 5-Year Estimates\n- Retrieved via tidycensus R package on in February 2026\n\n**Reproducibility:** \n- All analysis conducted in R version 2025.05.01+513\n- Census API key required for replication\n- Complete code and documentation available at: https://mamole27.github.io/PPA_Portfolio/\n\n**Methodology Notes:**\nThresholds and parameters followed explicitly given guidelines in this assignment.\n\n**Limitations:**\nAnalysis based on a small selection of counties for no particular reason.\n\n---\n\n## Submission Checklist\n\nBefore submitting your portfolio link on Canvas:\n\n- [x] All code chunks run without errors\n- [x] All \"[Fill this in]\" prompts have been completed\n- [x] Tables are properly formatted and readable\n- [x] Executive summary addresses all four required components\n- [ ] Portfolio navigation includes this assignment\n- [x] Census API key is properly set \n- [ ] Document renders correctly to HTML\n\n**Remember:** Submit your portfolio URL on Canvas, not the file itself.
